                Starting from infancy, we are inundated by information from different sources. How
                do we choose which information to attend to and which source to trust? How do we
                interpret the information we receive? How do we revise what we believe? How do we
                justify our beliefs? What kind of biases do we show when seeking and using
                information? Are there cross-cultural differences in the development of social
                learning and reasoning? These questions constitute the focus of my previous and
                current research, whose overarching theme is the development of human social
                learning and reasoning. To answer these questions and reveal socio-cognitive and
                developmental mechanisms underlying human learning and reasoning, I conduct research
                with participants ranging from 3 to 55 years old with diverse cultural and
                linguistic backgrounds (from Turkey, the UK, and Canada).

                    How do young children selectively learn from others?
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base">
                    To evaluate informants’ credibility, preschoolers use epistemic and social cues
                    (Tong et al., 2020). Although previous studies showed that children selectively
                    trust informants who provide accurate and valid explanations (Koenig, 2012;
                    Corriveau & Kurkul, 2014), we did not know whether children prefer learning from
                    informants who offer explanations that align with their expectations. Inspired
                    by the notion of the brain as a prediction machine (Clark, 2013), in my master’s
                    thesis, I examined whether and how 5- and 6-year-old children (N=104) use the
                    match or mismatch between their prediction about how an informant would explain
                    a topic and an informant’s actual explanation to decide whom to learn from. We
                    found that 1) young children favored the informants who provided explanations in
                    line with children’s own expectations, and 2) they discounted relevant
                    information coming from informants who did not match their predictions. While
                    this tendency creates alignment in the learning context, it might also make
                    children erroneously discount good quality information coming from individuals
                    who explain differently than themselves.

                    Cross-linguistic differences in preschoolers’ social learning and reasoning
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base">
                    Preschoolers trust first-hand information over hearsay (Köymen & Tomasello,
                    2018). Yet, most of the selective trust studies are conducted with
                    English-speaking children. However, languages differ, with some explicitly
                    marking the reliability of the information. For instance, in Turkish, it is
                    grammatically obligatory to express how information was acquired (whether the
                    speaker is reporting direct observation or hearsay), while it is not obligatory
                    in English. We investigated whether Turkish-speaking children might be more
                    attentive and display an earlier sensitivity to such information when deciding
                    whom to believe than English-speaking children. In two projects (a collaboration
                    between Koç University, Turkey, the University of Manchester, UK, and the
                    University of Toronto, Canada), we examined how 3- and 5-year-old
                    Turkish-speaking and English-speaking children (N=290) talk about the
                    reliability of the information they received to convince someone, i.e., metatalk
                    (Özkan et al., 2023) and 2) revise their existing beliefs depending on the
                    reliability of the counterevidence. We found that children as young as three
                    years of age 1) produced metatalk to justify their beliefs and, 2) revised their
                    own beliefs based on the reliability of the information offered to them, 3)
                    Although Turkish-speaking children had advantages in justifying their beliefs,
                    both linguistic groups showed equal performance in revising their beliefs.

                    How do children and adults interpret others’ testimony?
                </h2>
                <p class="text-base">
                    Most studies of selective social learning target learners’ inferences about the
                    claims of a “generic” individual. Yet, we sometimes need to make
                    speaker-specific inferences using a person’s history to make sense of uttered
                    information. We examined whether and how 5-year-olds, 7-year-olds, and adults
                    (N=163) make inferences about the preferences of informants who always provide
                    good/bad/neutral comments. We found that starting from seven years of age,
                    children can infer that a neutral expression (“It’s okay”) might indicate
                    different levels of liking for someone who always provides positive comments
                    (“It’s good”) versus who always provides negative comments (“It’s bad”). This
                    finding highlights an additional step in selective social learning, the
                    calibration we make using an informant’s history when interpreting evaluative
                    information—an ability that develops with increasing age. Ongoing work is
                    probing younger children’s ability to make such inferences.

                    Biases in information seeking across the lifespan

                <p class="text-base">
                    We tend to seek, use, and remember more information in favor of our perspective
                    than those against it, i.e., confirmation/myside bias (Nickerson, 1998; Mercier,
                    2022). This bias leads to overconfidence and polarization (Mercier, 2022).
                    According to the Argumentative Theory of Reasoning, we should see this bias when
                    producing arguments to convince someone (Mercier & Sperber, 2011). Are we also
                    biased before producing arguments: when searching for information? We recently
                    started a preregistered study investigating the biases in information seeking
                    across the lifespan (5, 8, 11, 14, 18-24, 25-55-year-olds, Ntarget = 480)
                    depending on the aim of the information search and the presence of a conflicting
                    perspective. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to offer a
                    comprehensive developmental picture of the biases we show when searching for
                    information for different aims using a novel and same paradigm across the
                    lifespan.
